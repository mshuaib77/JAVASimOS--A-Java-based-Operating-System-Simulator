# JAVASimOS: A Java-based Operating System Simulator
 JAVASimOS is an innovative project aimed at simulating fundamental aspects of an operating system within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This simulation encompasses the core functionalities of an OS, including task switching, cooperative multitasking, and interrupt handling, without needing direct hardware access. By leveraging Java Threads, Timers, and Semaphores, JAVASimOS effectively demonstrates how an operating system manages a single CPU's resources among multiple programs, ensuring fair and reasonable resource distribution
At its heart, JAVASimOS introduces concepts like "kerneland" and "userland," bridging them through a simulated software interrupt mechanism, thereby emulating the transition between user mode and privileged mode as seen in actual operating systems. With userland processes built upon a base class implementing Runnable for task execution and a kernel component managing scheduling and process switching, JAVASimOS is a comprehensive educational tool. It offers insights into the operations of an OS, from boot-up and task scheduling to handling interrupts and executing user programs, all within a safe, controlled Java environment.

By completing the JAVASimOS project, we've laid down a foundation for understanding the intricate dance between software and hardware in operating systems, illustrated through Java's robust programming platform. This endeavor not only deepens the knowledge of OS principles but also sharpens Java programming skills, particularly in areas concerning concurrency, thread management, and system architecture design.
