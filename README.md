# JAVASimOS: A Java-based Operating System Simulator
 JAVASimOS is an innovative project aimed at simulating fundamental aspects of an operating system within the Java Virtual Machine (JVM). This simulation encompasses the core functionalities of an OS, including task switching, cooperative multitasking, and interrupt handling, without needing direct hardware access. By leveraging Java Threads, Timers, and Semaphores, JAVASimOS effectively demonstrates how an operating system manages a single CPU's resources among multiple programs, ensuring fair and reasonable resource distribution
